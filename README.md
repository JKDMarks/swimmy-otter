A game of dodging logs and grabbing clocks.

## Inspiration

I wanted to make a game in vanilla JS and learn about the difference in paradigms between game and web development. Plus, otters are cute.

## Features

Returns a user object given a username. If no user exists with that username, creates one with that name and sends it forward.

Receives scores from the front end, stores them, and sends forward the scores when requested.

## Built With

* [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) - Database management library

## Notes

Any resemblance to the name of any notorious mobile game is purely coincidental.
